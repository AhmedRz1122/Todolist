# Todolist
 A simple todo list app using react and vite with tailwind.css for styling
 # iTask - Personal Todo App

A simple yet functional personal task manager built using **React**. With iTask, you can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The app also uses **local storage** to save your tasks, ensuring they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks by typing into the input box and clicking the "Save" button.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify an existing task using the edit button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove a task using the delete button.
- **Mark as Complete**: Check off tasks as complete with a checkbox.
- **Toggle Visibility**: Show or hide completed tasks using the "Show Finished" checkbox.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain available even after a page reload.

## Project Structure
- **App.jsx**: The main component of the application that handles the core functionality, state management, and renders the UI.
- **Navbar.jsx**: A reusable component for the navigation bar, providing links for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons to the buttons (`FaEdit` and `MdDelete`).
- **Local Storage**: To save and retrieve tasks between sessions.
- **CSS**: For styling the UI.
